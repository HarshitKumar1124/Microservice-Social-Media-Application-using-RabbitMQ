This micro-service is responsible for building connections and networks between different users.
This includes CRUD operations related to sending , receiving requests , follow and unfollow events etc.

To design a microservice architecture to handle "follows," "following," "followers," and "requests" in a social media application, you can create a dedicated "Social Graph Service" that manages these types of connections between users. This service would be responsible for handling all types of user relationship actions like following, unfollowing, accepting follow requests, blocking users, etc.
